# ImageSearchBot
A bot that continuously searches for an image and clicks on a match determined by another image when the first image appears.
This is code I wrote a while ago, but I wanted to put it on Git for my resume.
I created it to automate a simple game I was playing with friends.
When using the code, open it and replace target_image.png and target_bnt.png with the images you want the bot to search for and click on, respectively.
